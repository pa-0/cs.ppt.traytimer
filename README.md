# ZTrayClock

ZTrayClock is a simple C# application written to replace the default Windows clock with a pair of notification area (that is,
"system tray") icons.  It was inspired by another such application I saw back when I ran Windows XP whose name I have
since forgotten.

## Why ZTrayClock?

It is slightly smaller than the standard Windows clock on the Windows 7 taskbar.  Even though I have the notification area set
to hide most icons, I found the distance the clock made it protrude to the left quite bothersome.  I wrote this for use on my
laptop, which has a narrower screen than my desktop.

### Comparison

The difference isn't that drastic, but on a 1366x768 screen (such as my laptop's), every little bit helps.
